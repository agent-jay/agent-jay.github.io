I'm Siddarth Jayamoorthy, a second year Master's student at Indiana University,
Bloomington. My long term goal is to imbue machines with cognitive machinery
that we as humans take for granted- memory and the ability to transfer learned skills to
new tasks. Presently I'm working on Deep Reinforcement Learning and NLP.  Before
this, I was a data scientist for two years, fighting insurance fraud and
building Computer Vision algorithms.

I heard this quote a while back and it stuck with me.

> "When youâ€™ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post"- [@drob](https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440)

So that's what I started this blog. Also, I've been tinkering with deep
learning lately and this is a place to share the advice I would have given
myself before I started.
