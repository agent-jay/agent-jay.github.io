These are my picks for favorite Machine Learning MOOCs and lecture videos.
While they aren't updated often (or at all), I find myself coming back to these
whenever I need to recap important concepts. If you're looking for more
frequently updated content, look [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url

- [Machine Learning by Andrew
  Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)- The course that started
  it all, I won't say any more.
- [CS231 Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual
  Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)- The legendary course by Fei-Fei Li
  and her students (used to be Andrej Karpathy). Excellent lecture
  [notes](http://cs231n.github.io/) that you can always come back to.
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders by fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/)- A
  superb way of getting into modern Deep Learning implementation and research,
  this course espouses hands on learning over reading tomes of mathematics. In
  my opinion, this is the right way to learn a subject as complex and
  multifaceted as it's very easy to get stuck in dependency hell, reading more
  and more until you lose sight of why you were reading something in the first
  place. Guilty as charged :sweat_smile:.
- [Oxford Deep Learning for NLP](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures)- Cannot
 recommend this enough. Legends Phil Blumson and Chris Dyer build a solid
 foundation of concepts before gradually building up to modern deep learning
 architectures for NLP tasks such as Language Modeling, Machine Comprehension,
 Translation and Question Answering. It helps to practice coding small examples
 in parallel with watching the lecture videos.
- [Reinforcement Learning by David
  Silver](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html)- Highly
  recommended introduction to RL. Follow along with the canonical textbook by
  [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018mar11.pdf)
  and I promise you that you will be ready to understand modern research papers
  in the field. Silver is a phenomenal teacher, this is one of the best courses
  I have ever taken, period.
- [Deep RL by Sergey Levine](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)- This is
  not meant as an introductory course. You have been warned. That said, this
  course do provide a detailed treatment of optimal control and model based
  learning, which are really useful in robotics or really any application where
  you care about sample efficiency.

If you want to catch up on the latest happenings in the world of Deep Learning
or Reinforcement Learning research, summer schools and bootcamps are great. One
hour is often enough to get an overview of a topic, and fill up your reading
list.  The links below are a few years old, but still relevant as of 2018. I
would however suggest finding more recent talks or newer versions of these
summer schools.
