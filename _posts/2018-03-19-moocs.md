While they aren't updated often (or at all), I find myself coming back to
these whenever I need to recap important concepts. If you're looking for more
frequently updated content, look [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-03-18-stay-uptodate-ml-ai %}).

- [Oxford Deep Learning for NLP](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures)- Cannot
 recommend this enough. Legends Phil Blumson and Chris Dyer build a solid
 foundation of concepts before gradually building up to modern deep learning
 architectures for NLP tasks such as Language Modeling, Machine Comprehension,
 Translation and Question Answering.
- [CS231 Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)- The
 legendary course by Fei-Fei Li (and earlier Andrej Karpathy). Excellent
 lecture [notes](http://cs231n.github.io/) that you can always come back to.
- [Reinforcement Learning by David Silver](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html)- Highly recommended introduction to RL. Follow along with the canonical textbook
by [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018mar11.pdf)
and I promise you that you will be ready to understand modern research papers
in the field. Silver is a phenomenal teacher, this is one of the best courses I
have ever taken, period.
- [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)-
 The course that started it all, I won't say any more.
- [Deep RL by Sergey Levine](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)- This is
  not meant as an introductory course. You have been warned.

If you want to catch up on the latest happenings in the world of Deep Learning
or Reinforcement Learning research, summer schools and bootcamps are great. One
hour is often enough to get an overview of a topic, and fill up your reading list.
The links below are a few years old, but still relevant as of 2018. I would
however suggest finding more recent talks or newer versions of these summer
schools
